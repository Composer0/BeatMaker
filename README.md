# Music Maker
Music Maker Project.

Project is responsive but is not meant to work on devices smaller than a tablet at this time. For best user experience please use a tablet or PC. (It can still work on a smart phone but animations are limited and sizing in a vertical space is cumbersome.)

Project focuses on the use of creating sequences within JavaScript to play sounds in a looped pattern. Tracks are introduced to change the sound of the selected track which are based on the displayed instrument.

Piano Player has been introduced into the program and features fully playable keys that can work simultaneously with the Beat Maker. Piano Player functions through linking data.audio to keydowns of keys found in array.

Features to be added.

Navigation input that will slide the Piano Player into full view from off screen. Navigation will have to be mobile friendly. TranslateY will have to altered in media query as well.

Needs a record button to record auto while "jamming'.

Add more piano keys.

Add track to piano player that allows all keys to become a different sound. Seperate file folder may make the task easier.

Fun feature is to allow instrument families to be swapped into Beat Maker(must add additional sound files as well).

Transfer Beat Maker inputs into music notation of quarter notes and quarter rests.
